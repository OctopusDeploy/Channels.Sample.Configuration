# Channels.Sample.Configuration
The Octopus Configuration for each scenario in the [Channels.Sample walk through](http://octopus.com/blog/channels-walkthrough). Check out the Channels features in [Octopus 3.2](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-deploy-3.2-pre-release).

This repository has the exported Octopus Configuration data for each scenario in the walk through and is a good example of [managing Octopus Configuration with git](http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/display/OD/Data+migration).

Each scenario is available as a Release in this repository. Feel free to clone/fork the repo, or download each release as a zip file.
